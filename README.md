# Personal workflow repositories

## Tmux Configs
1. To install on mac:- “brew install tmux”
2. The control key for tmux is Ctrl-b. Anything in tmux is done via this keystroke.
3. Copy tmux conf as ~/.tmux.conf
4. Shortcuts for tmux:- [shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058)
5. To copy text in a tmux session press the alt key while selecting text. Else it will be in yellow and not copy when you just select and drag.
6. To keep SSH session alive to your external servers, copy ssh_config as ~/.ssh/config. On Mac, you will lose session when laptop is asleep or shutdown.

## Vim configs
1. Copy file as ~/.vimrc.
2. Uncomment the last line if you want to see white characters similar to Sublime Text.

## iTerm
1. This terminal emulator is far far superior to the inbuilt Terminal on MAC. Can have unlimited scroll history
2. [Themes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes) You just need to copy them over to the directory to get all themes. Instructions are clear.
3. Enable copy on select. By far, the most productive enhancement I’ve gotten from iTerm. No need to press CMD-C for copy.
4. For split pane in a single window:- CMD-D for vertical split, CMD-SHIFT-D for horizontal split. CMD-SHIFT-Enter for full screen of a pane.

## Zsh
1. This is a massive upgrade to bash!!! “brew install zsh”
2. Oh-my-zsh is a framework for zsh that supercharges it with awesome stuff. [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) Look at sections for plugins to install whatever aliases you want and themes (there are many many inbuilt ones).
3. One really great one is autocompletions [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)

## Visual Studio Code
1. One of the better editors out there. Well worth the investment for productivity improvements. Has inbuilt terminal, visual diff compare.
2. Extensions I have installed:- Python, GitLens (Shows git history on every line in a unobtrusive way. If used to Sublime or VIM key bindings, can install these as well.
3. Source Code Pro is a great font for coding environments and is easy on the eyes while working long hours:- [link](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)

I’ve found these to be greatly useful for my productivity on a day to day basis. You can pick and choose what you like to add. All of these things are set it and forget it stuff, so no meddling is needed in future.
